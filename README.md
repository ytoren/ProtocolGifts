# ProtocolGifts
Analysis of unstructured data from the "Protocol Gift Util" in the US department of state (all the official gifts accepted by the president). Quoting from the [U.S. Department of State website](http://www.state.gov/s/cpr/c29447.htm):

> The Protocol Gift Unit within the Office of the Chief of Protocol serves as the central processing point for all tangible gifts received from foreign sources by employees of the Executive Branch of the Federal government. The Unit is responsible for the creation and maintenance of the official record of all gifts presented by the Department of State to officials of foreign governments. Working closely with the Chief of Protocol and the staffs of the President, the Vice President, and the Secretary of State, the Gift Unit selects the gifts presented to foreign dignitaries. Gifts received by the President, Vice President, and the Secretary of State and their spouses from foreign governments are also handled by the Gift Unit in the Office of Protocol.
